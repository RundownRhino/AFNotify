# AFNotify
A notification program for AcolyteFight. It fetches the current counts on the servers you are interested in each 5 minutes and shows desktop notifications when the counts are high enough.

Requirements: [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)(`pip install requests`), and, only when notifications are enabled, [py-notifier](https://pypi.org/project/py-notifier/) (`pip install py-notifier`).
